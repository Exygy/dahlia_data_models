  "rental_history": "Our credit reporting agency also reviews eviction and court databases to search for both eviction filings and judgements within the past 24 months. No Fault or Dismissed evictions will not be held against the household. If a household does not meet the rental or credit criteria, they will then have the option of either paying an additional deposit equal to 1 times the monthly rent, or providing a qualified guarantor. If the applicant does not provide either of these options, it could result in the denial of their application. Mitigating Circumstances will be considered on a case by case basis.",
